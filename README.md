In this repository, there is a short paper on Nondeterminism, looking at NPDAs, NFAs, and NTMs. I chose to write about nondeterminism because on the last exam I found that I struggled the most on questions that reflected this concept. Most notably, I struggled with question 4: creating a NPDA for a given language L. I didn't realize I needed to make a NPDA and instead tried to use a DPDA, which much to my dismay did not work. Thus, this paper explores more about the differences between NPDAs, NFAs, and NTMs and their deterministic counterparts. I also connect nondeterminism and determinism to the complexity classes of P and NP. Lastly, I talk about why nondeterminism is important in a broader context and explore its practical applications.
